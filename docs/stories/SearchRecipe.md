## Search Recipes

> As a web designer I would like to retrieve recipes from the back-end system, so I can display them in my app

**Requirements:**

- Without any additional query parameters, should return all recipes known to the back-end service
- Support filtering based on recipe category
- Support search strings, with the service then trying to match these in relevant fields (for example name and category)
